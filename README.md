This is an SOP for setting up and collecting data using the Geodesic high-density EEG

## About the High Density EEG  
This is a very fancy, very expensive EEG cap. There are several reasons why it is especially important:    

          (1) This cap has 256 channels to record from, as compared to convential 32 or 64
          (2) This cap uses sponge electrodes soaked in an electrolyte solution. No irritating scrubbing, paste, etc, making this cap suitable to a wider range of participants.
          
Below is the SOP for setting up and collecting data.  

## Before your participant arrives
1) Get all the bits you need to setip: three cloth towels, electrolyte powder, shampoo, two buckets, measuring tape, a red skin-compatible pen, and a timer.
2) Prepare the bucket of electrolyte solution you will use to soak EEG cap. Mix together:  
  (a) 2L of deionized water 
  (b) Two scoops of baby shampoo (we use Johnson&Johnson)
  (c) Two scoops of electrolyte powder 
  

## When your participant arrives  
1) Measure their head. You'll need to measure their circumfrence, with the measuring tape going over their ears, above the inion, and centering the nasion.  
2) Based on their head size, decide what cap to use. If on the cusp of a size, chose the smaller.  
3) Begin soaking the cap in the electrolyte solution. The minimum time is 6 minutes, and the maximum is 15.   
      (a) When soaking make sure all electrodes are properly submerged, and give the cap a few dunks when first putting it in. Make sure NONE of the wires close to the white bundle are subemrged.  
4) While the cap is soaking, determine CZ on the participant; mark with a red X. 
5) After CZ is determined and the cap is done soaking, place the adaptor at the end of the EEG cap in a towel in the participant's lap. Lift the cap from the solution, spreading it wide with your fingers. 
6) Instruct the partici
